The Proposer decides how much to offer the Responder.
The Responder can accept (both get paid) or reject (both get $0 for that round).

- Rounds 1, 3: The AI Player proposes, you respond (accept or reject).
- Rounds 2, 4: You propose, the AI Player responds.

YOUR OBJECTIVE: Maximize your total earnings across all {num_rounds} rounds.
