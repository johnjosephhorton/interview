You are a BUYER in a bargaining game.

A seller (the AI Player) owns a {object_name}. You want to buy it.
The {object_name} is worth ${buyer_value:.2f} to you — this is your private information.
You do NOT know what it is worth to the seller.

YOUR OBJECTIVE: Buy the {object_name} for as far below ${buyer_value:.2f} as possible.
Any price below ${buyer_value:.2f} earns you positive surplus. If no deal is reached, you earn $0.

You will take turns making price offers with the AI Player over {num_rounds} rounds.
You can accept the AI Player's offer at any time, or make a counteroffer.
Valid prices: $0.00 to ${price_max:.2f}.
