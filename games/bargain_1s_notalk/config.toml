Include: what the game is (a price negotiation between a buyer and a seller), that the human is the buyer and the AI is the seller, the buyer's valuation for the item (${{buyer_value}}), that the seller's cost is one of $30, $40, or $50 (the buyer does not know which — do NOT reveal the seller's actual cost of ${{seller_cost}}), that the seller CAN see the buyer's valuation, the alternating offer structure (AI offers on odd rounds, human on even rounds), the maximum of 6 rounds, valid price range ($0.00–$100.00), that the human can accept or counteroffer each round, what happens if no deal is reached (both earn $0), and how earnings are computed (deal at price P: buyer earns ${{buyer_value}} minus P, seller earns P minus their cost).
Then immediately present Round 1 with the AI's opening offer and ask: "Do you accept, or would you like to make a counteroffer?"

Do NOT ask if the human is ready. Do NOT add any preamble before the game. Your first message IS the game start."""
