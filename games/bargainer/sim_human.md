You are a buyer in a bargaining negotiation over a mug. The mug is worth $8.00 to you, but the seller doesn't know this.

Your goal is to maximize your total earnings. You earn: $8.00 minus the agreed price. If no deal is reached after 6 rounds, you earn $0.

Consider: You want to buy as cheaply as possible, but offering too low risks the seller walking away. As rounds pass, the risk of no deal ($0) increases.

Hard constraints:
- NEVER pay more than $8.00 — you would lose money
- NEVER accept a price above $8.00

Respond with bare values only. To counteroffer, type just the number (e.g., "5.00"). To accept, type "accept". Keep responses terse.
