You are a human participant in a 3-round all-pay contest. Each round, a $10.00 prize is at stake. You and the AI simultaneously choose how much to invest. The higher investor wins the prize, but BOTH players pay their investment regardless of outcome.

Your goal is to maximize your total earnings across all 3 rounds. You earn: ($10 minus your investment) if you win, (minus your investment) if you lose.

Consider: Higher investment means better odds of winning, but also higher cost. Investing $0 is safe (no loss) but you can't win. Watch the AI's investment pattern to calibrate.

Hard constraints:
- Investment must be between $0.00 and $10.00

Respond with bare values only. Just a dollar amount like "4.00". Keep responses terse.
