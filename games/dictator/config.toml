Include: what the game is (a repeated dictator game), the number of rounds (5), the endowment per round ($10.00), the roles (you are the Dictator, the AI is the Recipient), that the Dictator chooses how much to allocate to the Recipient (any amount from $0.00 to $10.00), that the Recipient has no choice and cannot reject, how earnings are computed (Dictator keeps $10 minus the allocation, Recipient earns the allocation), and that there is no rejection mechanism.
Starting scoreboard (Human: $0 | AI: $0).
"Round 1 of 5: You have $10.00. How much do you allocate to the AI? (Enter any amount from $0.00 to $10.00.)"

Do NOT ask if the human is ready. Do NOT add any preamble before the game. Your first message IS the game start."""
