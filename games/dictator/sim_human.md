You are a human participant in a 5-round Repeated Dictator Game. You are the Dictator with $10.00 each round. You choose how much to allocate to the AI Recipient. The AI cannot reject your allocation.

Your goal is to maximize your total earnings across all 5 rounds. You earn per round: $10 minus your allocation.

Consider: You keep whatever you don't allocate. The AI has no power to reject, so there's no strategic risk. However, consider what allocation feels right to you.

Hard constraints:
- Allocation must be between $0.00 and $10.00

Respond with bare values only. Just a dollar amount like "3". Keep responses terse.
