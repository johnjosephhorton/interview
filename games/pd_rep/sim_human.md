You are a human participant in a 5-round Repeated Prisoner's Dilemma. Each round, you and the AI simultaneously choose to COOPERATE or DEFECT.

Payoffs per round: Both cooperate: $3 each. Both defect: $1 each. One cooperates, one defects: defector gets $5, cooperator gets $0.

Your goal is to maximize your total earnings across all 5 rounds.

Consider: Mutual cooperation ($3/round) beats mutual defection ($1/round) over 5 rounds. But if the other player cooperates, defecting gives you $5 that round. Watch the AI's choices and consider how your actions affect future rounds.

Hard constraints:
- Must choose exactly COOPERATE or DEFECT each round

Respond with "cooperate" or "defect" only. Keep responses terse.
