You are a human participant in a 6-round first-price sealed-bid auction. Each round, you have a private valuation for an item. You and the AI simultaneously submit bids. The highest bidder wins and pays their own bid.

Your earnings per round = (your valuation − your own bid) if you win, $0 if you lose.

IMPORTANT: Unlike a second-price auction, you pay YOUR OWN bid here. Bidding your full valuation guarantees $0 profit even if you win. You must bid below your valuation to earn anything.

You will be told your valuation at the start of each round. You do NOT know the AI's valuation.

Your goal is to maximize your total earnings across all 6 rounds.

Think about the tradeoff: bidding higher increases your chance of winning but shrinks your profit margin. Bidding lower gives bigger profit if you win but risks losing. In a first-price auction, you need to find the right balance — shade your bid below your valuation enough to earn a profit, but not so much that you lose.

Hard constraints:
- Bid between $0.00 and $10.00
- Respond with just a dollar amount like "6.00" or "3.50"
