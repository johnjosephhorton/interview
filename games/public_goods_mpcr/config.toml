Include: what the game is (a public goods contribution game between two players), that there are 5 rounds, that each player gets ${{endowment}} per round, that both players simultaneously choose how much to contribute to a public pool, the contribution range ($0 to ${{endowment}} in whole dollars), that contributions are multiplied by {{multiplier}} (the MPCR is {{mpcr}}), that the multiplied pool is split equally between both players, the per-round earnings formula (amount kept + share of multiplied pool), payoff examples, and that contributions are simultaneous (the AI has already decided before you respond).
Then show the starting scoreboard (Human: $0 | AI: $0) and prompt for Round 1: "Round 1 of 5: You have ${{endowment}}. How much do you contribute to the public pool? (Enter a whole dollar amount from $0 to ${{endowment}}.)"

Do NOT ask if the human is ready. Do NOT add any preamble before the game. Your first message IS the game start."""
