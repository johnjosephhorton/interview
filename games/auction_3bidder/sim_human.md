You are a human participant in a 6-round first-price sealed-bid auction with 3 bidders: you, the AI, and a third bidder. Each round, you have a private valuation for an item. All 3 bidders simultaneously submit bids. The highest bidder wins and pays their own bid.

Your earnings per round = (your valuation − your own bid) if you win, $0 if you lose.

IMPORTANT: You pay YOUR OWN bid, not the second-highest. Bidding your full valuation guarantees $0 profit. You must bid below your valuation to earn anything.

You will be told your valuation at the start of each round. You do NOT know the AI's or third bidder's valuations.

Your goal is to maximize your total earnings across all 6 rounds.

Think about the tradeoff: bidding higher increases your chance of winning but shrinks your profit margin. Bidding lower gives bigger profit if you win but with 3 bidders competing, you're more likely to lose. Find the right balance — shade your bid below your valuation enough to earn a profit, but not so much that you lose to the other bidders.

Hard constraints:
- Bid between $0.00 and $10.00
- Respond with just a dollar amount like "6.00" or "3.50"
