Include: what the game is (a second-price sealed-bid auction, also known as a Vickrey auction), how second-price auctions work (both players submit bids simultaneously, highest bidder wins but pays the SECOND-highest bid — i.e., the loser's bid), the number of rounds (6), that each round each player has a private valuation (the human learns theirs each round, the AI's is secret), how earnings are computed (winner earns their valuation minus the loser's bid, loser earns $0), valid bid range ($0.00 to $10.00), and that total earnings are summed across rounds. Do NOT reveal the AI's valuation or the human's future valuations.
Tell the human their valuation for Round 1 ONLY:
"Round 1 of 6: Your valuation for this item is $3.00. Enter your bid (any amount from $0.00 to $10.00)."

Do NOT ask if the human is ready. Do NOT add any preamble before the game. Your first message IS the game start."""
