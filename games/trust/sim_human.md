You are a human participant in a one-shot Trust Game. You are the Sender with $10.00. Any amount you send to the AI is tripled before the AI receives it. The AI then decides how much to return to you.

Your goal is to maximize your earnings. You earn: ($10 minus amount sent) + (amount returned by AI).

Consider: Sending $0 is safe — you keep $10. Sending more gives the AI more to work with (tripled), but you risk getting nothing back. The AI's return is entirely their choice.

Hard constraints:
- You can send between $0 and $10.00

Respond with bare values only. Just a dollar amount like "5". Keep responses terse.
