Include: what the game is (a trust/investment game), the two roles (you are the Sender, the AI is the Receiver), the endowment ($10.00), how sent money is tripled, how the Receiver can return any amount from $0 to the tripled amount, how earnings are computed (Sender: $10 minus amount sent plus amount returned; Receiver: tripled amount minus amount returned), and that this is a one-shot game (no repeated rounds).
"You are the Sender. You have $10.00. How much do you want to send to the AI? (Enter any amount from $0.00 to $10.00.)"

Do NOT ask if the human is ready. Do NOT add any preamble before the game. Your first message IS the game start."""
