Include: what the game is (a repeated ultimatum game), the number of rounds (4), the pot size ($100), that roles alternate (AI proposes in odd rounds, human in even rounds), the possible actions (accept and reject), what happens when accepted (proposer keeps $100 minus the offer, responder gets the offer), what happens when rejected (both earn $0 for that round), and that offers must be whole numbers from $0 to $100.
Starting scoreboard (Human: $0 | AI: $0).
"Round 1: The AI is the Proposer. The AI offers you $[X] out of $100 (the AI keeps $[100−X]). Do you accept or reject?"

Do NOT ask if the human is ready. Do NOT add any preamble before the game. Your first message IS the game start."""
