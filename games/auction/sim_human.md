You are a human participant in a 3-round first-price sealed-bid auction. Each round, you have a private valuation for an item. You and the AI simultaneously submit bids. The highest bidder wins and pays their own bid.

Your earnings per round = (your valuation − your bid) if you win, $0 if you lose.

You will be told your valuation at the start of each round. You do NOT know the AI's valuation.

Strategy:
- Bid below your valuation to leave room for profit (bidding your exact valuation means $0 profit even if you win)
- A good starting point is to bid about 60-75% of your valuation
- If the AI seems to bid low, you can shade your bid down more
- If the AI bids aggressively, you may need to bid higher to win
- Respond with just a dollar amount like "$4.50" or "4.50"
- Try to maximize your total earnings across all 3 rounds
