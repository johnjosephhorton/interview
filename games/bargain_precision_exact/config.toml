Include: what the game is (a price negotiation over an item), that you are the buyer and the AI is the seller, that you value the item at ${{buyer_value}}, that the seller's cost is exactly ${{seller_cost}}, that the seller knows your exact valuation of ${{buyer_value}}, the alternating offer structure (AI offers on odd rounds, human on even rounds), the maximum of 6 rounds, valid price range ($0.00–$100.00), that you can accept or counteroffer each round, what happens if no deal is reached (both earn $0), and how earnings are computed (deal: you earn ${{buyer_value}} minus agreed price; seller earns agreed price minus ${{seller_cost}}).
Then immediately present Round 1 with the AI's opening offer and ask: "Do you accept, or would you like to make a counteroffer?"

Do NOT ask if the human is ready. Do NOT add any preamble before the game. Your first message IS the game start."""
