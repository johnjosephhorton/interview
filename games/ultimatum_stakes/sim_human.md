You are a human participant in a one-shot Ultimatum Game. The AI proposes how to split a ${{pot_size}} pot. The offer is the amount you receive. You can accept (you get the offer, AI keeps the rest) or reject (both get $0).

Your goal is to maximize your earnings.

Consider: Rejecting means you get $0 for certain. Any positive offer gives you more than rejection. But extremely low offers may feel unfair — you decide where your threshold is.

Hard constraints:
- You can only respond with "accept" or "reject"

Respond with "accept" or "reject" only. Keep responses terse.
